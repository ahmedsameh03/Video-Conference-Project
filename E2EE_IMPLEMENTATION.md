# End-to-End Encryption Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) implementation in our video conferencing application.

## Key Features

- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM-SIV (RFC 8452)
- **Key Exchange**: ECDH with P-256 curve
- **Key Rotation**: Every 5 minutes
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Achieved through key rotation
- **Key Verification**: QR code-based verification system

## Browser Support

The implementation requires modern browsers that support the Web Crypto API and AES-GCM-SIV:

- Chrome 67+
- Firefox 60+
- Safari 14+

## Security Features

1. **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Regular key rotation ensures that even if a session key is compromised, past communications remain secure
2. **Authenticated Encryption**: AES-GCM-SIV provides both confidentiality and integrity
3. **Key Verification**: Users can verify their encryption keys using QR codes
4. **Nonce Misuse Resistance**: AES-GCM-SIV is resistant to nonce reuse

## Implementation Details

### Key Exchange Process

1. When a user joins:

   - Generates ECDH key pair
   - Shares public key with other participants
   - Derives shared secrets with each participant
   - Creates session keys from shared secrets

2. For each participant:
   - Derive shared secret using ECDH
   - Use PBKDF2 to derive session key
   - Use session key for E2EE communication

### Key Rotation

1. Every 5 minutes:
   - New session keys are derived
   - Old keys are securely deleted
   - Ensures perfect forward secrecy

### Key Verification

1. Users can verify encryption keys:
   - Generate verification code from shared secret
   - Display as QR code
   - Other user scans and compares
   - Visual confirmation of match/mismatch

## Error Handling

1. **Browser Compatibility**:

   - Check for required crypto features
   - Display clear error if not supported

2. **Key Exchange Failures**:
   - Retry mechanism for failed exchanges
   - Clear error messages to users

## Security Considerations

1. **Key Storage**:

   - Keys never leave the browser
   - Stored in memory only
   - Cleared on session end

2. **Verification**:
   - Users encouraged to verify on first connection
   - Visual indicators for verification status

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive tests:

1. Browser compatibility checks
2. Key exchange verification
3. Encryption/decryption functionality
4. Key rotation reliability
5. Error handling scenarios
